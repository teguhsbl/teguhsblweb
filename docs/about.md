## Web Design 
My journey into web design was fueled by a love for creativity and aesthetics. It must have been my wish that design is more than the looks of it because it should enhance the usability and effectively convey your intended message. To the smart interface navigation, I make sure to design and develop the user interface that is friendly, exciting and easy to use. 


## Vue. js Development
As a Vue. In my position as JS developer I employ this novel Javascript framework to build progressive and optimized apps. Vue. via js, i can develop nice and functional UIs of applications without much of a hassle with the help of js. Whether I am coding a simple application that will need an SPA or a large complex system built on components, I ensure that the code is clean, readable to ensure that it can be expanded in the future.
